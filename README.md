### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona with 5+ years of experience in the software industry. I have also worked as a designer on small projects and at a movie studio as a camera woman and as a film editor to feed the artist in me 👩🏻‍🎨

- 🔭 I’m currently working at [IntentHQ](https://intenthq.com/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about deployments and Scala with the functional approach
- 🤓 I am most comfortbale coding in Javascript and Typescript
- ⚡ Fun fact: I feel learning Scala has made me a much better Front End developer, thanks to its stric typing and approach on immutability
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects that help people live a better life

I don't spend much time on personal projects that involve coding, as you can see from the lack of public repos owned by me 🕷️🕸️. I spend my free time rock climbing, running, watching movies, attending live music events and reading books, lots of books 🐁📚 I like to read programming books or books related to the industry, like [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/) (a good classic and a must) and [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/), and mostly books that talk about the human mind 🧠 . Some of my favourites ones so far are [The Coaching Habit](https://boxofcrayons.com/about/the-coaching-habit-book/), [Extreme Ownership](https://echelonfront.com/books/extreme-ownership/), [Lost Connections](https://thelostconnections.com/), [In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts](https://drgabormate.com/book/in-the-realm-of-hungry-ghosts/) and the [Myth of Normal](https://drgabormate.com/book/the-myth-of-normal/).
